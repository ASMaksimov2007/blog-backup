I'm Alex Maksimov, a student in Moscow, Russia. I like coding and reading books about coding.

In this blog I share my ideas, thoughts, moments and milestones of my life.

My favourite sport is football (soccer) and I also take up volleyball and table tennis.

I think knowing about culture, religion and art is an essential part of our life, so make sure to check out [my Culture page]({{ site.baseurl }}/culture/).

I'm also a competitive programmer. [Here's my profile at Codeforces.](https://codeforces.com/profile/HurricaneCoder)

And yes, I have [a GitHub profile](https://github.com/ASMaksimov2007).
