# Overview

This is a tutorial on how to get a programmer setup from Ben Eater's video. He doesn't explain this process there, so here you are on my small sketchy tutorial.

Below are OS-specific setup instructions. Flick me a PR if you think something's wrong.

# Linux (Ubuntu & Debian-based)

Install dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config git libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

Then the actual software:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro.git
cd minipro
make
sudo make install
```

Restart the shell session (your terminal). You should be now able to run Minipro.

# Linux (other distros)

Follow the installation instructions on the Minipro GitHub: [https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro/#installation-on-linux](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro/#installation-on-linux)

# PriceyOS (MacOS)

Follow the installation instructions on the Minipro GitHub: [https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro/#installation-on-macos](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro/#installation-on-macos)

# Windows

This one is gonna be hard. Minipro is not available for Windows, however, there is a somewhat appropriate solution.

### Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

This is a piece of Microsoft software that allows you to run Linux systems within Windows without using a virtual machine (e.g. there is less stuff that can go wrong).

Follow the installation instructions on the Microsoft Docs: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

### Install the Chinese drivers for the programmer

The .rar file is here: [](http://www.xgecu.com/MiniPro/xgproV1039_setup.rar)

Unpack it and run the file inside (you will have to trust the communists that they haven't put any hammer and sickle viruses in). Follow the instructions of the wizard. Then restart your computer.

### Fix USB issues

By default, WSL does not see the USB ports on your computer. However, as the programmer is connected via one of them, you will have to attach them to the WSL session.

Do this: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb#install-the-usbipd-win-project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb#install-the-usbipd-win-project)

**NB**: you can't do the next step without the programmer connected to one of your computer ports. If you know what USB 3.0 is, make sure you connect the device to it (as the programmers require high current to operate). A Thunderbolt / USB-C port should also suffice.

Now this (**don't** do step 5): [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb#attach-a-usb-device](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb#attach-a-usb-device)

# Try to run the programmer

When in your active WSL session from the previous step (or the ordinary terminal, if you're not on Windows), go to your ROM file folder (which was generated by a Python script provided by tutors or Ben Eater) and try running

```bash
minipro -p AT28C256 -w rom.bin
```

Fingers crossed, that should work. Ask tutors for help and Alex for more written tutorials like this. Good luck!
