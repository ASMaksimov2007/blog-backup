This day, at 14:35 UTC, a CodeForces contest #753 will take place.

This will be the first contest for me to update my rank and perhaps it will decrease my rating if I perform bad enough :)

This day is important. If I succeed, then I continue to Div2, not Div3. Wish me luck :)

My rating is 1233 at the moment of writing.
