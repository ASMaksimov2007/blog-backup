title: Typing progress is made

Recently I started thinking about my typing speed. Currently I have ~20 WPM when not looking at the keyboard and ~35 WPM when looking. This is a crucial problem if I want to succeed in competitive programming.

I am practising on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) and [Ratatype](https://ratatype.com). My typing speed is increasing every day and I plan to get it to 90 WPM till December 31st.
