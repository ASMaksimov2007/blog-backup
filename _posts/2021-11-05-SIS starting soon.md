The information about upcoming SIS.Winter 2022 will be available in some days.

I'm going to pretend to be a 3rd level participant, as I have already qualified for 2nd level by passing the exam perfectly.

I hope to pass the test for 3rd level good enough to study with different people and different knowledge level. Theoretically, I can succeed there.

I'm waiting for information about SIS for about a month and can't wait to participate in qualifying exams.
