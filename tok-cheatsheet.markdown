# How to be good at TOK

## Disclaimer

This cheat sheet was written based on the 2024 exams TOK syllabus. Any changes to your particular program **should override this document**. Use the information provided here with consideration of program specifics.

## Course description

Your TOK course will cover 4 topics, one per term. The remaining 2 terms in Y12 will prepare you for 2 assessments:

1. TOK Exhibition. This assessment contributes 35% to the final TOK mark. You will have to choose one of 35 fixed IA prompts (see the IB TOK Guide or your book, the Student's Guide) and pick 3 objects from the real world. You will need to write 950 words of commentary to demonstrate how TOK manifests in the world around us. The objects you choose have to be linked to the prompt; more on that later.
2. TOK Essay. This assessment contributes 65% to the final TOK mark. You will have to choose one of 6 essay prompts that are different each year (yours will be released in March 2025) and write a 1600 word response to the prompt based on 2 areas of knowledge; more on that later.

Good news: T3 Y12 does not have any TOK, you will have free periods instead.

## What to do if you hate TOK

Understandable. Here are some steps that might help:

1. Read the book on TOK (the Student's Guide). Might sound like a terrible idea, but it discusses stuff that you will never touch on in the course, and it is quite entertaining if you pick some arbitrary chapters.
2. Think about what you don't like in TOK. If it's the way the material is presented, refer to the book or YouTube for better explanations.
3. If you find it simply boring or basic, read *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality* which can be found on [hpmor.com](https://hpmor.com). Each chapter presents a certain TOK/decision theory/philosophy concept, and the book itself is extremely well written and much more entertaining than the original.
4. If you find it difficult, also read HPMOR ;) Also challenge youself and ask youself questions. You don't even need to come up with answers on the spot, just think about some TOK questions in your free time, think of yourself as a philosopher.
5. If it's the teacher who you think ruins the experience, make the most out of the book material. You can also have a chat with some of the Y12s, such as myself (the author of this precious document).
6. Remember: you don't have to like TOK to get good marks.

## How to get good marks

You will technically be assessed at least 4 times throughout the course, with some minor works in Y11 to check your knowledge of a particular topic. The 4 assessments are:

1. Mini exhibition task (T3 Y11). Same as the real Exhibition, but with 1 object and 300 words. Counts only towards your internal report (and is worth no marks).
2. Mini essay task (T4 Y11). 4 prompts, 600-800 words (subject to change). Counts only towards your internal report (and is worth no marks).
3. TOK Exhibition (T1 Y12). Marked out of 10, worth 35% towards your IB TOK result. You will have to submit a draft and you will receive feedback to improve your final submission.
4. TOK Essay (T2 Y12). Marked out of 10, worth 65% towards your IB TOK result. You will have to submit a draft and you will receive feedback to improve your final submission.

Now to the actual general tips:

1. Do your best on the Mini tasks. Good performance on those and valuable use of feedback will give you an advantage when doing the actual IB assessments.
2. Discuss your work with peers. Do not plagiarize - develop your own ideas.
3. Read the marking rubrics. They include everything you need to have.
4. Use terminology wisely and don't waste words.
5. Referencing matters - don't use generic references, they weaken your argument. Particularly important for the images of objects in the Exhibition. However, you should not compose your argument from others' ideas - if you have too many references, it is a red flag.
6. Go for clarity and logical reasoning, not for complexity of language.

## Assessment-specific tips

## Exhibition

This one is a very difficult one to nail. There are 3 things you should address:

1. Specific real-world context of the object.
2. Connection between the object and the chosen prompt.
3. Justification for inclusion of the object in the exhibition.

You have 300 words for a single object (plus a safety net of 50 words for all objects). It is worth it to address each section with a single paragraph of 100 words.

The objects **do not** have to be connected with you or with each other.

You **do not** need to create explicit links to TOK Concepts. You can still do it if it is relevant.

### Specific real-world context

1. State when and under what circumstances the image of the object was taken.
2. Never use generic objects or a category of objects. You need to be extremely specific.
3. As said before, use convincing referencing.
4. Address parts of the context that are relevant to your prompt in more detail.
5. For some objects, such as photos of arts, consider including the viewers' reaction to the creation/release of the object at the time it was released. Sometimes it can be relevant to your prompt.

### Connection to the prompt

1. Has to be explicit, logical and clear.
2. Use TOK terminology here when needed. Refer to real-world context you stated in the first paragraph to support your argument.
3. Think about how the object addresses all keywords in the prompt.
4. End the paragraph with a conclusion (the structure is somewhat similar to Lang&Lit essays)
5. Do not use the phrase "the object is connected to the prompt because ...". It is extremely annoying, uses up words and has no meaning. Better relate the context with the prompt so that they smoothly blend together.

### Justification

The previous 2 points were not very difficult and are well explained on TOK lessons. This one is quite difficult to understand from the rubric.

My explanation for it is as follows:

> Explain how the perspective this particular object portrays on the prompt is **different** from other objects' perspectives and how they give a diverse educated answer to the question by working together.

1. It is worth it directly comparing the objects and giving backlinks to other objects in this section, but do it concisely in a couple of words.
2. Choose the objects with this section in mind. Make sure the objects demonstrate various ways to answer the prompt.
3. Remember that knowledge questions don't often have a single answer.
4. Keep referring to real-world context - different contexts influence possible perspectives.
5. Explore possible ways the object itself allows to hold different perspectives.
